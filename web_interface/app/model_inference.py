    Reads images from a path in the file system. Then the image is
    transformed to be processed by the classification model. Resizing,

    Parameters
    ----------
    image_path : str
        The path where the image is stored.
    rescale_size : int, optional
        The size to which the width and height of the image should be

        the neural network was pretrained (default is 224).

        A three-dimensional Pytorch Tensor representing an image.
